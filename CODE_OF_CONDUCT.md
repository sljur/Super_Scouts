# Code of Conduct

Super Scouts is an open and inclusive community that values the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. To foster a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors, we have established this Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in Super Scouts a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and empathetic towards other contributors.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being open to constructive criticism and feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards others' perspectives and experiences.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment or trolling of any form, public or private.
- The use of offensive language or imagery.
- Personal or political attacks.
- Any form of discrimination.
- Disruptive comments in discussions.
- Any other conduct that could be considered harmful to the community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. The maintainers have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Incidents

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers by contacting the Super Scouts team members. All reports will be kept confidential, and you will not face any retaliation for reporting.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated in the Super Scouts community. If a contributor engages in unacceptable behavior, the maintainers may take appropriate action, including a warning, suspension, or permanent ban from the project, as deemed necessary.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.

## Summary

The essence of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that Super Scouts is an inclusive and respectful community. All contributors and participants should feel safe, valued, and appreciated. We encourage everyone to help enforce these guidelines and make our project a welcoming space for all.

Thank you for your contribution and support.
