# Deliverable 5: Design

## Description:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main overview of our system starts with the homepage; it should welcome users to the website, encourage them to create their group if they are not part of one already, or to sign in to a group they are already apart of. Once an action is taken- whether it's because they created a group or signed in the next page should be the homepage of their particular group instead of the main website's. This will open up the tabs and links to the rest of the site's features; the Calender, Progression Tracker, Media, and their profile page. The group's homepage should also have a timeline that shows previous or upcoming events of that particular group. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we only have the main website page up with a small group creation feature without login abilities, and on the individual groups page we only have the link to the Calendar working. This was because we as a group realized the main aspects of our website needed to be group creation and the calendar; if we want people to use our website, at the minimum users would need to be able to create their group, and they needed to keep track of events for that group. We're currently in development of the Progression Tracker code, which will allow for the ability to create Milestones and Badges for the group in question. The more we work on it, the more was can continue to add necessary aspects to make the website more functional, like Media and Messaging capabilities.<br>
## Architecture:
Our system design consists of three layers: data, business logic, and presentation layer. Data includes datatypes such as Calendar, Badge, and Milestones. The business logic includes Members, Group Leader (who can create the calendar and give permission), and  Progression Tracker (that creates the badges and milestones). The presentation is comprised of a website that runs on a web server.

## Sequence Diagram:
Use Case <br>
Actor(s): Group Member (Primary), Group Leader (Dependent)<br>
Description: The group member wants to add an event to the group calendar.<br>
Preconditions: A personal computer, an internet connection, a SuperScouts membership, and group registration.<br>
Postconditions: An event request will be handled and the requesting member will be notified of the result.<br>

Main Flow:
1. A group member creates an add event request
2. The group leader is notified of the request
3. The group leader approves the request
4. The event is available in the calendar
5. The group member is notified of the approved event request
   
Alternative Flow:
1. The group leader rejects the request
2. The group member is notified of the rejected event request

## Design Patterns:

### Design Pattern 1:
- The first Design Pattern chosen (Observer) is from the Behavioral category; this was chosen because our 'Group Leader' is in charge of the 'Group' that every member will be linked to. When the 'Group Leader' makes an update to the calendar, every group member should be able to see the updated events.

Group Leader: https://github.com/sljur/Super_Scouts/blob/main/website/grouphome.html <br>
Calendar: https://github.com/sljur/Super_Scouts/blob/main/website/Calendar/script.js <br>

### Design Pattern 2:
- The second Design Pattern chosen (Facade) is from the Structural category; this was chosen because the user only needs to interact with the PT (Progression Tracker) and does not need to worry about the interworkings of both the milestones and badges if the options needed for them are present in the PT interface directly.

## Design Principles:
To represent the S.O.L.I.D. principles, we used several of the solid strategies within our system's design to help promote efficiency and provide structure within our project. Beginning with the Single Responsibility Principle, we have shaped our classes so that they each occupy a specific niche within the group space on our website, meaning that a group's calendar is responsible for their event planning, the progression tracker is responsible for keeping tabs on group milestones and group messaging is specific to inter-group communication exclusivley. We used the Liskov Substitution Principle to help organize our classes, specifically when defining what a leader is to a group and how we can derive a leader class from a member class. The Dependency Inversion Principle was used to help keep group communication simplified, meaning that whena group sends a message or uploads a post, not all posts will require the same level of backend support (i.e. a video will require more abstraction than a text).
