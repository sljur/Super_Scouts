# Deliverable 5: Design

## Description:
   The main overview our our system start with the homepage; it should welome users to the website, encoruage them to create thier own group if they are not apart of one already, or to sign in to a group they are already apart of. Once an action is taken- whether it's because they created a group or signed in- the next page should be the homepage of thier paticualr group instead of the main website's. This will open up the tabs and links to the rest of the sites features; the Calender, Progression Traker, Media, and thier own profile page. The group's homepage shoudl also have a timeline that shows previous or upcoming events of that paticular group.
   Currently, we only have the main website page up with a small group creation feature without login abilities, and on the individual groups page we only have the link to the Calendar working. This was because we as a group realized the main aspects of our website needed to be group creation and the calender; if we want people to use our website, at the minimum users would need to be able to create their own group, and they needed to keep track of events for that group. The more we work on it, the more was can to continue to add neccessary aspects to make the website more funcitonal, like the Progression Tracker and Media abilities.
