1. Create a Group
2. Have them go into each tab; the Progression Tacker, Calendar, and Game.
3. In Progression Tracker tab, have them add/ remove a milestone; <-Ask them questions about each action; Easy or difficult;
4. In Calendar tab, have them add/ remove an event; <-Ask them questions about each action; Easy or difficult; 
5. In the Game tab, have them play the game!; <-Ask them if they can see members competing with this game or something similar; do they like the setup, presentation, the idea?

Reflection:

How would you describe the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?)
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application?
On the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?
What features worked well? 
What can be changed? 
How is the learning curve of your system? 
Did the users perform the tasks as you expected? 
Did the users’ actions produce the results they expected?
 What did the users like the most?
