Description of Calendar Implementation:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for this particular implementation was for us to have a large enough calendar to be easily read instead of our initial one which was smaller in size. We hoped that with a larger calendar, we could also implement an add and remove event function and be able to place those events on a specific day. However, creating a popup that appears when a member clicks the calendar and disappears on another click took far longer than expected, so only the modal popups, along with the add and remove functions are stable enough to present. Also, as of right now, I can only make the events that are added appear in a list inside the modal popup itself. Although it won’t be ready for this implementation, my next step is to move the events from the modal into the calendar itself. 

     
### Tests:
- this is where tests will go

## Demo:
- Please enjoy our demo of SuperScouts 0.1.1 Alpha
  demo should go here

## Code Quality:
- Quality Assurance decisions should be made here

## Lessons Learned:
- We needed to continue sharing information we found out about JEST, along with what tests worked for one person but didn’t for another; and clarifying how the test needed to be written in order to get through the JEST environment.
- Specifically for the Calendar implementation, we learned that just because there is a tool that does something we need, does mean that is the correct tool to use; had more research been done prior to implementing the calendar code, whole sections would not have needed to be modified and replaced, taking up time we could have used to further the implementation.
