## Summary Of Activities
- We delved rather deeply into how we wanted to complete Deliverable 2; what needed to be decided immediately versus what could wait;
which parts could be split up versus what everyone needed to work on, and more importantly, how to split up the work fairly so everyone
could partake in the workload.
- This meant we determined that we would divide up our User Cases and Stories by what features we wished to be apart of the project long-term;
as well as figured out that we wanted our User Stories to feature both a group leader and a group member, and thier perspectives on how they
would use our product.
- Determing how we wished to set up Deliverable 2 meant we only briefly discussed the index.html pages we set up.
  
## Project Retrospective
- Although we weren't able to deeply showcase our work with the index.html pages, we all agreed it was good to get some practice in setting
 them up regardless.

### Activity Checklist 
 1. Appreciations: 
   * Everyone did their best to contribute to how we wanted Deliverable 2 to be formulated.
   * Evan did a good job organizing all our ideas and writing them out on the white board.
   * Ben made sure to jump start the conversation and had good ideas for how to set up the Deliverable.
   * Dalton clarified parts of the User case, and gave reminders for certain parts of the Deliverable we overlooked.
   * Beatriz reminded us that we could use the draw.io for our diagrams, and then shared the document with us.
   * Patricia helped out with the pull requests and with adding things into our notes/documents.
   * Sami helped create the issues in github so we could edit them later.
   * Ben's Parents offered to pay for our server, which we all greatly appreciate! 

2. Successes:
   * Everyone was present and accounted for, despite illness going around.
   * We all worked on the next Deliverable, and attempted to organize it in a easy-to-manage way.
   * No arguments to be had; always very civil discussions and gentle reminders when we may have missed something.

3. Failures: 
   * No failures; we just had to stay a little later than we normally would have to make sure everyone understood hwo we were going to
    coordinate the Deliverable to make sure it's meets the requirements.

4. Barrier: 
   * Only two barriers that can be seen currently is that we as a group just need to get more used to using Github, and comprehension
    of what our deliverable instructions are asking of us, both of which can be easily remedied.

5. What we should try next time.
   * Making a time to check-in throughout the week was a good idea from a previous report, that we should look into doing.
   
## Next Steps
- Next time we wanted to take a moment and look at what each of us had come up with in regards to our index.html pages, even if we
don't spend a lot of time on them.
- Look into Deliverable 3 and see what we could get started earlier versus later.
- Look into Domain names and their cost; now that we have a server, we need a domain name to go with it, and determine how much money
we would need to pitch in for the domain name we want.
