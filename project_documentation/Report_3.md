## Summary of Activities
- We discussed how our interviews went and what were some of the main feedback we received. In general, we got positive feedback from our interviewees. 
- A concern was brought up about how we would get engagement from the users. We came up with several possibilities for this. We essentially wanted something that would catch their attention and encourage them to check the site everyday.Some ideas include adding Javascript Game, streaks like SnapChat, Animal Crossing Esque idea, Wordle, or daily login points. Essentially wanted a way to reward users who are consistently on the site.
- As a group, we brainstormed a very general idea for the main page design of the website. For our navigation bar, we wanted a calendar, files, progression tracking, communication, and home/settings. We also wanted some sort of timeline that includes a particular organization and main feed. Also need a profile button. For all the information displayed, we decided to just use fake data for now.
- We looked over Deliverable 2 to prepare and/or ask questions ahead of time.

## Project Retrospective
- Deciding that each of us will write up a draft of the layout of our home page may take some time individually to do, but not only is this good practice for writing out other parts of our website in the future, but it’ll also show where each member’s expertise lies.
- We are now moving from setting requirements and the inception phase to designing the website itself, so we will have to start focusing on how to connect and/or implement certain features or aspects of it
- Another result of moving to the design phase is that we must all familiarize ourselves with GitHub as we will be committing and editing on there far more than we have prior to this point 

### Activity Checklist
1. Appreciations: 
   * Everyone contributed and was actively engaged in the discussion. 
   * Samantha was great at directing the conversation.
   * Beatriz and Dalton did a good job of taking notes during the meeting.
   * Evan, Ben, and Patricia gave feedback fast on the report as QA’s.

2. Successes:
   * Everyone was present.
   * Discussed a general idea of what we wanted in our design.
   * We started a bit on the next deliverable. 

3. Failures: 
   * We did not really have any failures, just made changes based on what would benefit us as a group. For example, we agreed on not having a server for right now and just having our website files on GitHub as there was not much benefit for having it running constantly on a server.

4. Barrier: 
   * Since we are all familiar with web programming, there should be little to no issues with programming the home page. The only other barrier may be properly committing to dedicated branches on GitHub.

5. What we should try next time.
   * Establish when to communicate throughout the week.
   * Possibly start putting our weekly tasks up on GitHub as an issue (might be easier to track that way).

## Next Steps
- Next week will have a more in-depth discussion of our website's design, outside of the landing page.
- Start working on a draft of Deliverable 2.
- Officially decide on the type of engagement we want to implement based on the options provided during this meeting.
