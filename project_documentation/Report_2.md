## Summary of Activities
- With introductions out of the way it is time to get to work. With this weeks meeting we began laying the ground work for our website and made plans for exactly how we wanted to get started. To start we discussed the most prevalent issues we missed from our previous meeting, those being the activity sheet and how group decisons would be made when not unanimous.
- As a group we decided against the use of the activity sheet in favor of a weekly document filled out in our group meetings. This was done as we thought it would be a simpler option when compared to the spread sheet and would be easier to read when later having to fill out the report. This document includes, what tasks we are after for the week, a game plan for how to tackle each issue and who was assigned what task. Updates are made as needed throughout the week as needed.
- In regards to group decisons we opted to go for the simplest choice of the provided 2/3rds vote suggestion. We also agreed that with respect to non-participating members, we decided a warning would be given if 2/3rds of the group deemed it necessary and we would proceed on a situational basis from there.
- Interviews were a major part of this weeks progress beginning with writing the questions we would be asking. Thes consisted of asking for background information, thoughts on our potential features, criticisms they might have and a value assessment of our project as a whole.
- In terms of this weeks work each member conducted a series of interviews to determine how should we best design our project with the user in mind. We also began steps to acquiring a server as Evan mentioned he had a hostwinds server we could operate from. Linking our repository and the server became the next step and now that our interviews have been conducted we can begin the design process.
- We discussed our Initial Value proposition and decided to stick with scouting as our main focus for initial interviews while taking into consideration the application of our project to other group based organizations or clubs for future development. 

## Project Retrospective
- Our project's title "Super Scouts" is likely to change in the coming weeks as we implement user suggestions. We unanimously agreed however it was an excellent name to build off of and would give our project a sense of identity.
- Considering the requirements for these projects as mentioned in class, we looked forward as to how or when we might be able to implement C/C++ code into our project where it would exist as a web based program almost entirely. With some research our most likely option is implementing JavaScript in some capacity using a C++ program for supplementary functions or utility.
- Connecting the parts of this project is still a daunting task, however with the creation of our repository we have a base to build upon. In the coming weeks we will begin designing and writing code and give structure to our suggested features. 

## What Comes Next
- Following this week's interviews and server linking we will begin the design process from the information we have gathered and the features we dicussed.
- To encourage progress we set some milestones for our repository. The first of which being the implementation of a first index html file to mark the website's beginning. In general this initial file is likely to be scrapped entirley, but for the immediate future we plan to build the website's structure and work from their.
- Ultimately we plan to have our website based from a password locked account system and that will shape how the features we discussed will be introduced.
