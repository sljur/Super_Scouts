1. Are you in scouting, or have been in an organization like scouting before?
2. What is your most prevelant issue with communicating inside an orgaization? 
3. What communication platforms do you use right now for your organizations? 
4. What is your biggest gripe about your chosen platform of communication?
5. These are features we were thinking of creating:
         *Place to input ranks, merit badges; Progression tracking
         *Person in chrage (Ie. scoutmaster, patrol leader) could sign off on items scouters have done
         *Personal Account and Troop Account (leader of organization has more control of set up, but person who made it can 
          send a code to prospective members, and memebrs have thier own accounts similar idea to Discord)
         *Ability to add and remove events
         * Possible to upload documents or hikes that people have gone on with points of interest
         ; which ones would benefit you?
6. Is there any features or additions you would suggest?
7. If the we created a website that was more general and for more organizations, would you use this outside of scouting?
8. Is this idea of ours a must have; nice to have; or a don't care item?
