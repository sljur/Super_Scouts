# Introduction:<br>
Humans are social creatures by nature, for centuries we have survived through communication and collaboration, why in the age of the Internet should we strive for anything less? We are more connected to each other now than we have ever been in history and yet when working in a scouting troop or similar community-based organization; planning events and group discussions can be difficult, especially between members from different generations. Super Scouts is a website designed to optimize group and community activities through intuitive design and easy-to-use features. Users sign up and are either given a code from our site or from their troop leader, allowing for easy creation and joining of online groups. Groups on our site will be able to enjoy file sharing, forum discussion, and community posts from other members of their troop. Future work could include geolocation to allow troop leaders to mark trails.

# Interviews:
## Interview: 1<br>
**Summary:** Sonya and I mostly discussed how our idea, based on the interview questions, sounds like a social media app but for scouts; she likes the idea as a nice-to-have, but would be very cool if she were able to keep track of the kids progress and then be able to print out what everyone did at the end of the month. She also thought it would be cool if we were able to post photos as proof of project completion, and if there was a centralized system instead of having to use facebook messenger, scoutbook, and regular phone calls and texts to communicate with everyone.<br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** Sonya Jurado<br>
**Date:** September 12th, 2023; Tuesday at 3:00pm <br>
**Consumer Segments:** Sonya is a den leader of a cub scout pack and a committee member of that pack; she did a brief amount of time in Girl Scouts as a kid, but now has her daughters in a cub scout pack.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- The idea that we're attempting to make a social media platform for scouts? I didn't think of it like that, but that's how Sonya described our idea. (Specifically, like a "skype+outlook+the social media of facebook+ progression tracking like blackboard thing."
- She really wanted to be able to post photos of proof that a merit badge or item had been completed, as a way of proof; Because you can post things on Facebook, but it wouldn't be linked as progression. They also don't really use Facebook for anything other than messaging.
- She mentioned that even though ScoutBook (the main progression app they use) keeps track of their monthly dues for the pack, they cannot actually pay their local Scout council from the app itself. So it tells them what they owe, but they can't pay it.
- We discussed the idea of making the website more general and having pre-loaded page set-ups depending on which organization was using the website, which would possibly lighten our workload.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "It would be nice to have a central program that had the ability to message or to check things off as completed" This is kind of what we mentioned at the meeting, that we would like troops or packs to be able to communicate within their own group;
- "Skype+outlook+the social media of facebook+ progression tracking like blackboard thing." Putting this down again because it was an interesting way to look at what we're trying to do, even if that wasn't the main intent; like, I don't think we'll have many skype-like or outlook-like functions, but maybe a discord+blackboard mix?
- "It would be nice to be able to include photos of the particular scout project; scoutbook does not have the ability to upload a photo of rank completion. Like an ability to create a memory; evidence the child completed this task." Uploading images for progression proof!
- "The things with scout books tells you when your monthly dues are due, but no way to directly pay the local council your dues even though scoutbook tells you what money is due. " Ability to pay dues!

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid):**<br>
- The social media aspect; that description is still getting to me because although we did want a communication factor, that's not how we described it to ourselves.
- They are ways to make Scoutbook better, even though the current system they're using is workable.
- A fully fleshed-out version of our idea will probably take way more time and effort than we have available, even though we might be able to get the bare bones set up.
- Being able to pay for their money dues! I forgot those were a thing, honestly, I wasn't the parent paying for them as a kid.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- She said it would be a 'Nice to Have' but mentioned it would be a *super cool* nice-to-have if it meant all of the things they needed to access for scouts (Calendars, photos, events, messaging, progression) could be in one centralized location. Especially if the app itself could be private and communication limited between people in the same troop/pack, so the parents don't have to worry about kids being on another social media platform. They could just be on the scout's version. 

## Interview: 2<br>
**Summary:** We discussed having a single platform as a point of contact for Scouts would be appreciated, but also how it would be super cool for certain features like electronic permission slips to exist, or a way to link someone's RSVP of an event to a page that could take rolecall of the kids who actually RSVP'd. Dave was far more a 'must have' view on this product because the multiple avenues for communicating, coordinating events, and keeping track of what child has done what merit badge "frustrates me. Greatly." <br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** David Jurado<br>
**Date:** September 12, 2023; Tuesday at 7:00pm<br>
**Consumer Segments:** Dave is a parent who is a part of his daughter's cub scout committee as an event coordinator<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Very vocal about the desire to have communication, calendars, and progression tracking all in one place.
- Something I (the interviewer) didn't realize was that although Dave mentioned that his pack uses email, phones, and Facebook messenger to communicate, he explained not all of the adults in his pack have/give out an email for communication. They view it as personal and don't like sharing it.
- The main reason he dislikes the ScoutBook app (the official scouting app) is that user intuitiveness is not there. Difficult to navigate.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Communication and calendars is absolutely a must." 
- "Tracking advancement would be at the top; in order for this app to work at all, need to be able to keep track of rank advancement." For both communication, calendars, and tracking advancement, he really just wants everything in one place.
- "...Could be better if we put an event of a hike on calendar, the adult with permissions or older scout RSVPs “I’ll be there” but on the day of, you have the ability to do roll call and check off who actually went based off of RSVP" So basically, and RSVP linked to a Scout's account that that could record who attended what event to keep track of later. ( Things we could implement and/or interesting points discussed )
- "I want to be able to add a pack-add a person to my pack by having them scan a QR code. Set them up in there, give them permissions, bada bing bada boom." This one is pretty self-explanatory; Dave wants to use technology to make life easier; interesting, and sounds similar to Discord.


<br>**Hypotheses (Valid):**<br>
- The electronic permission slips; The ability to just go into your phone, find the permission slip that needs signing, sign it electronically, and have the person in charge of the event sign off as well. Basically, remove the need for the printer and have to remember paper permission slips.
- The QR code idea; I'm not sure how feasible it is- to have someone added to a pack's or troop's account via a code, but it's not too different from the Idea we already had about links being sent to invite someone.
-  Reconfirmed the idea that there really is a desire to have a scouting or general app that could keep track of communication, calendars, Progression tracking, and documents all in one place.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- Dave, mentioned that this app was a 'Must have' for him, because in his words, "We live in a digital age and we now have the ability to track kid's achievements from a centralized source; so if kids have to move from state to state, they don’t have to lose out because of the move." He also mentioned that if the website could cover not just scouting but different organizations, he wouldn't have a problem using the product; but he worries by making it less scouting-specific, it may lose out on the things that would make it useful for any one group. But he does think it would be amazing if it could exist.

## Interview: 3<br>
**Summary:** Griselda and I discussed what she would like in a website for scouting if she were to ever consider putting her son in a scout group. She likes the idea of a website where she can communicate with others and have all the information, such as events, in one place.<br>
**Interviewer:** Beatriz Ortega<br>
**Interviewee** Griselda Vitela<br>
**Date:** September 13, 2023<br>
**Consumer Segments:** Griselda is a parent who might consider putting her son in a scouting group and has never used any communication app for organizations.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Simple layout for the website
- Needs to be easy communication between a parent and scout leader
- Event calendar would help keep events organized 
- Help/tutorial guide of the website

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- “I don’t want to be overwhelmed with too much going on in the site.”
- "I like the idea of an event calendar because it is nice to have the events listed all in one place."
- "If I were to ever let him join a scouting group I know I'd have tons of questions so it is important I have communication with whoever would be responsible for him."
- "A website like this sounds like a good idea. Having everything in one place would allow me to not stress about me possibly missing anything."

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- We never thought of any sort of help/tutorial guide on how the website works. Some parents may not be computer-savvy or never used a site like this so they might struggle to know what is what on the site. We can have a help guide page that explains the different aspects of the website. Another option is the pages we end up having could provide a brief summary of what it covers or its purpose.
- The website needs to be easy to navigate with a simple design/layout.
- This definitely reconfirmed the idea of having a website where everything such as event calendars and communication is in one place when it comes to scouts/organizations.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Need/Don't Care:**<br>
- A simple and easy-to-navigate layout is a must.
- A sort of help or tutorial guide on the website is nice to have.
- Event calendar is a must.
- Direct communication with the scout leader is a must.

## Interview: 4<br>
**Summary:** We chatted a little about how the Girl Scouts is set up versus Boy Scouts/Scouting, and the fact the Girl Scouts don't even have access to something like ScoutBook, so most of their documentation is paperwork-based, which means they have to keep track of all the day-to-day paperwork themselves. She mentioned aspects she thought would be pretty cool - a place to keep their PDfs, a section to list allergies of their scouters to know who was allergic to what, and that a tab dedicated to finances would be pretty cool. Very much insistent on the desire for a user-friendly interface with easy to understand tabs and sections.<br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** Meggan Walsh<br>
**Date:** September 13, 2023; Wednesday, 5:00pm<br>
**Consumer Segments:** She is a parent who is a Girl Scout leader in her daughter's Troop.Her daughters were both apart of Scouting prior to joining Girl Scouts.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Currently, Meggan's troop is using a platform called Band to communicate within their troop. It's like Whatsapp, but without the ability to make phone calls. Very limited ability to post any photos, no capacity for calendars. Texting and that it. Because the Girl Scouts have no official app to use, and a lot of red tape in what they are allowed to use, Band has been their basic go-to, but it's not well-liked.
- Definitely loves the idea of a troop universal calendar to keep everything together; would also appreciate anything that would make progression tracking more online with less paperwork. Currently, the Girl Scout troop has to print everything out by hand and does not have access to something similar to ScoutBook
- Was not a fan of ScoutBook when she used it previously for her kids; for her, it was difficult to navigate and was not user-friendly. in her opinion.(List things you thought were interesting )

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Additionally, medical stuff, like allergies; What if you have a new troop leader and they want to bring in a snack? Who is allergic to what? It would be nice if we could be aware of it." Not something I thought about, and that is more private information than we were looking to host on the website, but not an entirely bad idea. Perhaps something that could be entered into their Profile page, if they have a personal account?
- "Upload images of what they were working on." She is also very much for the ability to post photos to go along with progression tracking as proof of items done. But also wants a place to create albums for events completed or done.
- "The kids to do GirlScouts cookies, so tracking cookies sales would be nice; and Due’s, what needs to be paid; tracking capability for finance stuff, basically. I hate keeping track of that." So, a way to let them track of their cookie sales; Scouts does Popcorn Sales as well, and I believe there are many organizations that do their own fundraising. It might be out of our capability, but it'd be cool to think about.

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid):**<br>
- Really desired a communal calendar that was specific to scouting and events; which we kind of figured, but it's interesting to know that's a universal complaint.
- The financials; the idea of having an easy-to-use money tracking system specific to their desired organization. It seems obvious because everything takes money, but it really didn't hit me how difficult it would be for parents to juggle that along with all the other bills they need to pay. Again, probably because I was the kid when I was in Scouts.
- The allergy thing; Similar to the financials, it's not generally something I would think about, but a lot of organizations have potlucks where everyone brings food. Knowing what the majority of people just can't eat is probably a good idea.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
-  Overall, Meggan listed our idea as something VERY nice to have if it existed, just because although there are many apps out there, they are hard to use and don't do the main things Meggan would like to have in one place- which is Progression Tracking, Calendars, and communication all in one place. She would very much jump on having an app that could do all these things.

## Interview: 6<br>
**Summary:** Due to busy schedules, we both decided it was better to have specific questions answered via email. Amber is VP of a fraternity organization called Kappa Kappa Psi, which specializes in helping other music ensembles on campus. For the organization's communication, they use Email for formal communication and the BAND app for informal communication. Due to being a recognized organization, they must send information through multiple people in their hierarchy before it goes where it needs to, so the speed at which that happens is very important. For a new tool like this to be implemented for them, it would have to condense and mainstream communication, document storage, and website information; otherwise, it is a "Don't Care" for them.<br>
**Interviewer:** Dalton Tippings<br>
**Interviewee** Amber Young<br>
**Date:** September 15th, 2023<br>
**Consumer Segments:** She is a student at NAU and the VP of Kappa Kappa Psi, a fraternity organization dedicated to providing support to multiple music ensembles on campus.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- For their organization, they use multiple websites for information, storage, and different forms of communication. Could make a hub for access to all of that information.
- Having a way to combine formal and informal communication would eliminate using two separate applications, and also would be less taxing on the members.
- "Signing off members" was an interest. Could add in more actions higher-up members could use.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Adding more methods of communication tends to be taxing on us and our officers, however, ways to condense and mainstream this information would be something we would be greatly interested  in. Particularly, the Google drives (which we use for just document storage), chapter website, and official communication."
- "The biggest gripe about our communication is that to use E-Mail we have to send it to our organization list serve. Then our Secretary has to approve it which can take a long time and sometimes the email never gets through the list serve making communication a nightmare especially if it’s important and urgent information."
- "The most prevalent issue is members sending out information in advance and not last minute."
- "Chats (multiple) for communication would be helpful"

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- Did think that a chat system along with it would be very beneficial
- Brought up how having multiple forms of information/chats in one place would increase efficiency within the organization
- For mainstreaming information, being able to connect to other social media used for Alumni connections would be useful

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- The organization would consider this a "Don't Care" unless it could condense and mainstream multiple aspects: multiple forms of communication, document storage, and easily accessible information to display on the chapter's website (besides it being dedicated to Scouting).
- Amber believed the following proposed features could benefit them: person in charge of signing off items, ability to add/remove events, and uploading of documents.

## Interview: 7<br>
**Summary:** We discussed Calista's history in scouting and what were the largest issues in her experience with the organization. By far event planning was the largest issue in terms of both communication and transportation. While she did spend several years in scouting, much of Calista's experience is from her childhood so I began to ask about her experience in management and if there were any similar issues to those from her scouting experience. Communication again was the largest issue she could think of, remarking how both email and texts were largely the only tools for communication in both settings.<br>
**Interviewer:** Benjamin Huntoon<br>
**Interviewee** Calista Matthews<br>
**Date:** 9/15/23<br>
**Consumer Segments:** Calista is the manager of the city pools in Kingman Arizona, an instructor for the Red Cross, and a former Girl Scouts member/leader<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- For pool management, email is used as a primary communication tool, the ability to send email notifications would be a welcome feature.
- Group leaders allowed to create events would simplify the planning process greatly.
- Group-specific websites similar to our concept already exist (Red Cross website), a general website would be a useful tool.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "If I were still a Girl Scout leader I would use all of these features. As an instructor for the Red Cross, there is a website similar to what you are describing and I have used it since it started operating"
- "The most prevalent issue with troop leaders not communicating and being unable to find transportation so meetings were often canceled between the two"
- "Leaders would communicate last minute, sometimes members would already be at the location of the meeting and they would just tell us the that the meeting was canceled"

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- Confirmation that a group-based website has utility beyond a scouting context.
- Event planning should be one of the primary focuses of our project.
- A platform for group communication in a general context would be excellent for group-based organizations.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- Calista considered the project a must-have, citing the convenience of being able to have group discussions and event planning on the same platform.
- The specific features regarding scheduling and community discussions were given as justification as well, claiming they would be very helpful quality-of-life features in group settings. 

## Interview: 8<br>
**Summary:** Jorja is not a member of scouting, but she is involved with several club or group-based organizations on campus. In the interview, we discussed communication and what were the biggest flaws and successes of how the groups she knows communicated. The biggest drawback of already existent communication methods in a group (text, email, etc.) was the lack of a report feature for personal issues and potential conflict between group members. While she liked the overall concept of a website used for group settings, the emphasis on scouting to the overall project would take away from the utility of the website in a more general context.<br>
**Interviewer:** Benjamin Huntoon<br>
**Interviewee** Jorja Whitcher<br>
**Date:** 9/13/23<br>
**Consumer Segments:** Member of the Energy Club and the Theta Tau Engineering fraternity<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Conflict resolution should become an important part of the website's structure.
- File/Location sharing would be something unique among other group-based apps or websites.
- Overall the concept would be a good alternative to an email chain or group text for organizing group activities.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Overall communication is the biggest issue, people would either never hear about an event or just outright not respond to planned group activities or messages"
- "It was difficult to communicate issues, mostly personal issues, as there is generally no anonymous or private way to report problems to group leaders"
- "Inputting ranks could make some people feel less important/valuable than others."

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- The ability for group leaders to sign off and plan events would be a very useful tool.
- Member ranks could lead to a less inclusive space online.
- File and location sharing would be really helpful tools for planning group activities.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- Jorja listed this concept as a Nice to have item, citing the purpose as too specific for general use, but that it was a good idea overall.
- The ability to plan events on the website was given as a key feature that would  be useful in a group setting.

## Interview: 9<br>
**Summary:** Clyde Allen is an Assistant Manager at the University of Washingtion for Lab Studies. He is also a key role player in the Ventura County Council National Youth Leadership Training. Our main topic of the interview was the fact that youth participants don't respond or refuse to engage in communication. "Youth only respond, and then only occasionally, to text messages.  However, text messages are not adequate for conveying full details for any given communication need." said Mr. Allen. <br>
**Interviewer:** Evan Palmisano<br>
**Interviewee** Clyde Allen<br>
**Date:** 9/16/23<br>
**Consumer Segments:** <br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Biggest issue was about youth involvement and the quantity and quality of responses.
- There isn't a form of engagement available that compels youth members to respond.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- From an adult sending messages outbound, e-mail and Band both provide good platforms for conveying information.  Youth do not really respond to either.  The question is, why not?
- Honestly, unless the product can solve the youth engagement dilemma, it wouldn't materially improve what I need to do.

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- There needs to be a way to get youth to engage. We need to do something to solve that problem.
- The fix to that hasn't necessarily been found yet, as no current form of communication used is effective to entice responding.


<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- In conclusion, Mr. Allen saw our project concept as beneficial, but unless it will solve the prevalent theme of this interview, it's a "don't care".

## Interview: 10<br>
**Summary:** Mr. Hong and I talked about a multitude of sub-topics ranging from message quality to available content for use. The main forms of communication Mr. Hong uses within his organization include E-mail, phone calls, texts, and face-to-face. Some current issues he has include the necessity for too many channels. I believe this is a problem in the sense that the communication is not centralized and you have to go digging for information. It's not always easily accessible.<br>
**Interviewer:** Evan Palmisano<br>
**Interviewee** Thom Hong<br>
**Date:** 9/16/23<br>
**Consumer Segments:** <br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Large text chats are distracting and can have a low signal-to-noise ratio
- Main issue with online communication is that there are too many channels (subsurface chat groups) needed.
- access to uploading and viewing group documentation

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- Plugins to extend functionality (i.e. planning tool to define events in a calendar, allow documents like pack checklists to be associated with the event, and post photos specific to the event/patrol) might differentiate it with added value.
- Tools like Band are great. Would like to see a similar tool that is built around YPT, with a focus on giving the *youth* the main responsibility to send out messages.

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- Desired the use of plugins such as Google Calendar. Which I think is good because the more information users can get from our product, the less they have to use external resources and references.
- Documentation is another feature our group has been thinking about adding. Mr. Hong wishes for the same feature.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- Mr. Hong said that our product would be really, really, nice to have. 
I interpret that as they are functionally getting by with their current form of communication and that this would be an upgrade.
