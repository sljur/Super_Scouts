# Introduction:<br>
Humans are social creatures by nature, for centuries we have survived through communication and collaboration, why in the age of Internet should we strive for anything less? We are more connected to eachother now than we have ever been in history and yet when working in a scouting troop or similar community based organization; planning events and group discussion can be difficult especially between members from different generations. Super Scouts is a website designed to optimize group and community activities through intuitive design and easy to use features. Users sign up and are either given a code from our site or from their troop leader, allowing for easy creation and joining of online groups. Groups on our site will be able to enjoy file sharing, forum discussion and community posts from other members in their troop. Future work could include geolocation to allow for troop leaders to mark trails.
