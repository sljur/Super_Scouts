# Introduction:<br>
Humans are social creatures by nature, for centuries we have survived through communication and collaboration, why in the age of Internet should we strive for anything less? We are more connected to eachother now than we have ever been in history and yet when working in a scouting troop or similar community based organization; planning events and group discussion can be difficult especially between members from different generations. Super Scouts is a website designed to optimize group and community activities through intuitive design and easy to use features. Users sign up and are either given a code from our site or from their troop leader, allowing for easy creation and joining of online groups. Groups on our site will be able to enjoy file sharing, forum discussion and community posts from other members in their troop. Future work could include geolocation to allow for troop leaders to mark trails.

# Interviews:
## Interview: 1<br>
**Summary:** Sonya and I mostly discussed how our idea, based on the interview questions, sounds like a social media app but for scouts; she likes the idea as a nice-to-have, but would be very cool if she were able to keep track of the kids progress and then be able to print out what everyone did at the end of the month. She also thought it would be cool if we were able to post photos as proof of project completion, and if there was a centralized system instead of having to use facebook messanger, scoutbook, and regular phone calls and texts to communicate with everyone.<br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** Sonya Jurado<br>
**Date:** September 12th, 2023; Tuesday at 3:00pm <br>
**Consumer Segments:** Sonya is a den leader of a cub scout pack and a committee member of that pack; she did a brief amount of time in Girl Scouts as a kid, but now has her daughters in a cub scout pack.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- The idea that we're attmepting to make a social media platform for scouts? I didn't think of it like that, but that's how Sonya described our idea. (Speciafically, like a "skype+outlook+the social media of facebook+ progression tracking like blackboard thing."
- She really wanted to be able to post photos of proof that a merit badge or item had been completed, as a way of proof; Because you can post things on facebook, but it wouldn't be linked as progression. They also don't really use Facebook for anything other than messaging.
- She mentioned that even though ScoutBook (the main progression app they use) keeps track of thier monthly dues for the pack, they cannot actually pay thier local Scout council from the app itself. So it tells them what they owe, but they can't pay it.
- We discussed the idea of making the website more general, and having pre-loaded page set-ups depending on which organization was using the website, which would possibly lighten our work load.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "It would be nice to have a central program that had the ability to message or to check things off as completed" This is kind of what we mentioned at meeting, that we would like troops or packs to be able to communicate within their own group;
- "Skype+outlook+the social media of facebook+ progression tracking like blackboard thing." Putting this down again because it was an interesting way to look at what we're trying to do, even if that wasn't the main intent; like, I don't think we'll have many skype-like or outlook-like functions, but maybe a discord+blackboard mix?
- "It would be nice to be able to include photos of the particular scout project; scoutbook does not have the ability to upload a photo of rank completion. Like an ability to create a memory; evidence the child completed this task." Uploading images for progression proof!
- "The things with scout books tells you when your monthly dues are due, but no way to directly pay the local council your dues even though scoutbook tells you what money is due. " Ability to pay dues!

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid):**<br>
- The social media aspect; that description is still getting to me, because although we did want a communication factor, that's not how we described it to ourselves.
- They are ways to make Scoutbook better, even though the current system they're using is workable.
- A fully fleshed out version of our idea will probably take way more time and effort than we have available, even though we might be able to get the bare bones set up.
- Being able to pay for their money dues! I forgot those were a thing, honestly, I wasn't the parent paying for them as a kid.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- She said it would be a 'Nice to Have' but mentioned it would be a *super cool* nice-to-have if it meant all of the things they needed to access for scouts (Calanders, photos, events, messaging, progression) could be in one centralized location. Ecspecially if the app itself could be private and communcation limited between people in the same troop/pack, so the parents don't have to worry about kids being on another social media platform. They could jsut be on the scouts version. 

## Interview: 2<br>
**Summary:** We discussed having a single platform as a point of contact for Scouts would be appreciated, but also how it would be super cool for certain features like electronic permission slips to exist, or a way to link someone's RSVP of an event to a page that could take rolecall of the kids who actually RSVP'd. Dave was far more a 'must have' view on this product because the multiple avenues for communicating, coordinating events, and keeping track of what child has done what merit badge "frusterates me. Greatly." <br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** David Jurado<br>
**Date:** September 12, 2023; Tuesday at 7:00pm<br>
**Consumer Segments:** Dave is a parent who is a part of his daughter's cub scout committee as an event coordinator<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Very vocal about the desire to have communication, calendars, and progression tracking all in one place.
- Something I (the interviewer) didn't realize was that although Dave mentioned that his pack uses email, phones, and Facebook messenger to communicate, he explained not all of the adults in his pack have/give out an email for communication. They view it as personal and don't like sharing it.
- The main reason he dislikes the ScoutBook app (the official scouting app) is that user intuitiveness is not there. Difficult to navigate.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Communication and calendars is absolutely a must." 
- "Tracking advancement would be at the top; in order for this app to work at all, need to be able to keep track of rank advancement." For both communication, calendars, and tracking advancement, he really just wants everything in one place.
- "...Could be better if we put an event of a hike on calendar, the adult with permissions or older scout RSVPs “I’ll be there” but on the day of, you have the ability to do roll call and check off who actually went based off of RSVP" So basically, and RSVP linked to a Scout's account that that could record who attended what event to keep track of later. ( Things we could implement and/or interesting points discussed )
- "I want to be able to add a pack-add a person to my pack by having them scan a QR code. Set them up in there, give them permissions, bada bing bada boom." This one is pretty self-explanatory; Dave wants to use technology to make life easier; interesting, and sounds similar to Discord.


<br>**Hypotheses (Valid):**<br>
- The electronic permission slips; The ability to just go into your phone, find the permission slip that needs signing, sign it electronically, and have the person in charge of the event sign off as well. Basically, remove the need for the printer and have to remember paper permission slips.
- The QR code idea; I'm not sure how feasible it is- to have someone added to a pack's or troop's account via a code, but it's not too different from the Idea we already had about links being sent to invite someone.
-  Reconfirmed the idea that there really is a desire to have a scouting or general app that could keep track of communication, calendars, Progression tracking, and documents all in one place.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- For Dave, he mentioned that this app was a 'Must have' for him, because in his words, "We live in a digital age and we now have the ability to track kid's achievements from a centralized source; so if kids have to move from state to state, they don’t have to lose out because of the move." He also mentioned that if the website could cover not just scouting but different organizations, he wouldn't have a problem using the product; but he worries by making it less scouting-specific, it may lose out on the things that would make it useful for any one group. But he does think it would be amazing if it could exist.

## Interview: 3<br>
**Summary:** (This is where you would summarize your interview)<br>
**Interviewer:** Beatriz Ortega<br>
**Interviewee** Griselda Vitela<br>
**Date:** September 13, 2023<br>
**Consumer Segments:** Griselda is a parent who might consider putting her son in a scouting group and has never used any communication app for organizations.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Simple layout for the website
- Needs to be easy communication between a parent and scout leader
- Event calendar would help keep events organized 
- Help/tutorial guide of the website

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- “I don’t want to be overwhelmed with too much going on in the site.”
- "I like the idea of an event calendar because it is nice to have the events listed all in one place."
- "If I were to ever let him join a scouting group I know I'd have tons of questions so it is important I have communication with whoever would be responsible for him."
- "A website like this sounds like a good idea. Having everything in one place would allow me to not stress about me possibly missing anything."

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- We never thought of any sort of help/tutorial guide on how the website works. Some parents may not be computer-savvy or never used a site like this so they might struggle to know what is what on the site. We can have a help guide page that explains the different aspects of the website. Another option is the pages we end up having could provide a brief summary of what it covers or its purpose.
- The website needs to be easy to navigate with a simple design/layout.
- This definitely reconfirmed the idea of having a website where everything such as event calendars and communication is in one place when it comes to scouts/organizations.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Need/Don't Care:**<br>
- A simple and easy-to-navigate layout is a must.
- A sort of help or tutorial guide on the website is nice to have.
- Event calendar is a must.
- Direct communication with the scout leader is a must.

## Interview: 4<br>
**Summary:** We chatted a little about how the Girl Scouts is set up versus Boy Scouts/Scouting, and the fact the Girl Scouts don't even have access to something like ScoutBook, so most of thier documentation is paperwork-based, which means they have to keep track of all the daya-to-day paperwork themselves. She mentioned aspects she thought would be pretty cool - a place to keep their PDfs, a section to list allergies of their scouters to know who was allergic to what, and that a tab dedicated to finances would be pretty cool. Very much insited on the desire for a user friendly interface with easy to understand tabs and sections.<br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** Meggan Walsh<br>
**Date:** September 13, 2023; Wednesday, 5:00pm<br>
**Consumer Segments:** She is a parent who is a Girl Scout leader in her daughter's Troop.Her daughters were both apart of Scouting prior to joining Girl Scouts.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- Currently, Meggan's troop is using a platform called Band to communicate within their troop. It's like Whatsapp, but without the ability to make phone calls. Very limited ability to post any photos, no capacity for calendars. Texting and that it. Because the Girl Scouts have no official app to use, and a lot of red tape in what they are allowed to use, Band has been thier basic go-to, but it's not well-liked.
- Definetly loves the idea of a troop universal calander to keep everything togther; would also appreacite anything that would make progression tracking more online with less paperwork. Currently, the Girl Scout troop has to print everything out by hand, and does not have acccess to something similar to ScoutBook
- Was not a a fan of ScoutBook when she used it previously for her kids; for her, it was difficult to navigate and was not user-friendly. in her opinion.(List things you thought were interesting )

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Additionally, medical stuff, like allergies; What if you have a new troop leader and they want to bring in a snack? Who is allergic to what? It would be nice if wecould be aware of it." Not something I thought about, and that is more private information than we were looking to host on the website, but not an enitrely bad idea. Perhaps something that could be entered into thier Profile page, if they have a personal account?
- "Upload images of what they were working on." She is also very much for the ability to post photos to go along with progression tracking as proof of items done. But also wants a place to create albums for events completed or done.
- "The kids to do GirlScouts cookies, so tracking cookies sales would be nice; and Due’s, what needs to be paid; tracking capability for finance stuff, basically. I hate keeping track of that." So, a way to let them track of thier cookie sales; Scouts does Popcorn Sales as well, and I believe there are many organizations that do thier own fundraising. It might be out of our capability, but it'd be cool to think about.

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid):**<br>
- Really desired a communal calander that was speicifc to scouting and events; which we kind of figured, but it's interesting to know that's a universal complaint.
- The financials; the idea of having a easy-to-use money tracking system specific to thier desired organization. It seems obvious, because everything takes money, but it really didn't hit me how difficult it would be for parents to juggle that along with all the other bills they need to pay. Again, probably becuase I was the kid when I was in Scouts.
- The allergy thing; Similar to the financials, it's not generally something I would think about, but a lot of organizations have pot lucks where everyone brings food. Knowing what the majority of people just can't eat is probably a good idea.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
-  Overall, Meggan listed our idea as something VERY nice to have if it existed, just because although there are many apps out there, they are hard to use and don't do the main things Meggan would like to have in one place- which is Progession Tracking, Calanders, and communication all in one place. She would very much jump on having an app that could do all these things.

## Interview: 6<br>
**Summary:** Due to busy schedules, we both decided it was better to have specific questions answered via email. Amber is VP of a fraternity organization called Kappa Kappa Psi, which specializes in helping other music ensembles on-campus. For the organization's communication, they use Email for formal communication and the BAND app for informal communication. Due to being a recognized organization, they must send information through multiple people in their hierarchy before it goes where it needs to, so the speed at which that happens is very important. For a new tool like this to be implemented for them, it would have to condense and mainstream communication, document storage, and website information; otherwise, it is a "Don't Care" for them.<br>
**Interviewer:** Dalton Tippings<br>
**Interviewee** Amber Young<br>
**Date:** September 15th, 2023<br>
**Consumer Segments:** She is a student at NAU and the VP of Kappa Kappa Psi, a fraternity organization dedicated to providing support to multiple music ensembles on-campus.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- For their organization, they use multiple websites for information, storage, and different forms of communication. Could make a hub for access to all of that information.
- Have a way to combine formal and informal communication would eliminate using two separate applications, also would be less taxing on the members.
- "Signing off members" was an interest. Could add in more actions higher-up members could use.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
- "Adding more methods of communication tends to be taxing on us and our officers, however, ways to condense and mainstream this information would be something we would be greatly interested  in. Particularly, the google drives (which we use for just document storage), chapter website, and official communication."
- "The biggest gripe about our communication is that to use E-Mail we have to send it to our organization list serve. Then our Secretary has to approve it which can take a long time and sometimes the email never gets through the list serve making communication a nightmare especially if it’s important and urgent information."
- "The most prevalent issue is members sending out information in advance and not last minute."
- "Chats (multiple) for communication would be helpful"

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- Did think that a chat system along with it would be very beneficial
- Brought up how having multiple forms of information/chats in one place would increase efficiency within the organization
- For mainstreaming information, being able to connect to other social media used for Alumni connections would be useful

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Nice/Don't Care:**<br>
- The organization would consider this a "Don't Care", unless it could condense and mainstream multiple aspects: multiple forms of communication, document storage, easily accessible information to display on chapter's website (besides it being dedicated to Scouting).
- Amber believed the following propsed features could benefit them: person in charge signing off items, ability to add/remove events, and uploading of documents.
