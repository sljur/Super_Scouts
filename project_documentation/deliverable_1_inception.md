# Introduction:<br>
Humans are social creatures by nature, for centuries we have survived through communication and collaboration, why in the age of Internet should we strive for anything less? We are more connected to eachother now than we have ever been in history and yet when working in a scouting troop or similar community based organization; planning events and group discussion can be difficult especially between members from different generations. Super Scouts is a website designed to optimize group and community activities through intuitive design and easy to use features. Users sign up and are either given a code from our site or from their troop leader, allowing for easy creation and joining of online groups. Groups on our site will be able to enjoy file sharing, forum discussion and community posts from other members in their troop. Future work could include geolocation to allow for troop leaders to mark trails.

# Interviews:
## Interview: 1<br>
**Summary:** Sonya and I mostly discussed how our idea, based on the interview questions, sounds like a social media app but for scouts; she likes the idea as a nice-to-have, but would be very cool if she were able to keep track of the kids progress and then be able to print out what everyone did at the end of the month. She also thought it would be cool if we were able to post photos as proof of project completion, and if there was a centralized system instead of having to use facebook messanger, scoutbook, and regular phone calls and texts to communicate with everyone.<br>
**Interviewer:** Sami Jurado<br>
**Interviewee** Sonya Jurado<br>
**Date:** September 12th,2023; Tuesday at 3:00pm <br>
**Consumer Segments:** Sonya is a den leader of a cub scout pack and a committee member of that pack; she did a brief amount of time in Girl Scouts as a kid, but now has her daughters in a cub scout pack.<br>

<br>**Key Insights:**<br>
- The idea that we're attmepting to make a social media platform for scouts? I didn't think of it like that, but that's how Sonya described our idea. (Speciafically, like a "skype+outlook+the social media of facebook+ progression tracking like blackboard thing."
- She really wanted to be able to post photos of proof that a merit badge or item had been completed, as a way of proof; Because you can post things on facebook, but it wouldn't be linked as progression. They also don't really use Facebook for anything other than messaging.
- She mentioned that even though ScoutBook (the main progression app they use) keeps track of thier monthly dues for the pack, they cannot actually pay thier local Scout council from the app itself. So it tells them what they owe, but they can't pay it.
- We discussed the idea of making the website more general, and having pre-loaded page set-ups depending on which organization was using the website, which would possibly lighten our work load.

<br>**Memorable Quotes:**<br>
-"It would be nice to have a central program that had the ability to message or to check things off as completed" This is kind of what we mentioned at meeting, that we would like troops or packs to be able to communicate within their own group;
-"skype+outlook+the social media of facebook+ progression tracking like blackboard thing." Putting this down again because it was an interesting way to look at what we're trying to do, even if that wasn't the main intent; like, I don't think we'll have many skype-like or outlook-like functions, but maybe a discord+blackboard mix?
-" It would be nice to be able to include photos of the particular scout project; scoutbook does not have the ability to upload a photo of rank completion. Like an ability to create a memory; evidence the child completed this task." Uploading images for progression proof!
-" the things with scout books tells you when your monthly dues are due, but no way to directly pay the local council your dues even though scoutbook tells you what money is due. " Ability to pay dues!

<br>**Hypotheses (Valid or Invalid):**<br>
- The social media aspect; that description is still getting to me, because although we did want a communication factor, that's not how we described it to ourselves.
- They are ways to make Scoutbook better, even though the current system they're using is workable.
- A fully fleshed out version of our idea will probably take way more time and effort than we have available, even though we might be able to get the bare bones set up.
- Being able to pay for their money dues! I forgot those were a thing, honestly, I wasn't the parent paying for them as a kid.

<br>**Is Super Scouts! a Must/Need/Don't Care:**<br>
- She said it would be a 'Nice to Have' but mentioned it would be a *super cool* nice-to-have if it meant all of the things they needed to access for scouts (Calanders, photos, events, messaging, progression) could be in one centralized location. Ecspecially if the app itself could be private and communcation limited between people in the same troop/pack, so the parents don't have to worry about kids being on another social media platform. They could jsut be on the scouts version.
