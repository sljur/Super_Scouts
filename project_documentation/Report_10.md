## Project Retrospective
* This week we had a lot to discuss between the deliverable and the continuation of our Agile process and prepping for our next coding sprint. With another implementation deliverable around the corner we also discussed the specific features we planned to work on this week and next as well.
### Activity Checklist
1. Appreciations:
   * Evan is continuing development of the game implementation.
   * Ben is working on formatting the server backend for API support and C code to satisfy our C requirement 
   * Sam is overhauling the calender design curently in use to promote interactivity with the user,
   * Dalton begins development of the progression tracker for group activities.
   * Patricia and Beatriz ensuring quality across all deliverable aspects and code presented to the repository.
2. Successes:
    * We designated individual roles for the deliverable to help delegate the amount of work and keep individual work loads to a minimum.
    * We agreed to start coding early to help mitigate stress for next week.
    * We discussed specific design details we each wanted to see implemented in the project.
3. Failues:
   * No major failures; we have an outline of what needs to happen and how to do it.
4. Barrier:
   * Some aspects of the design process have not been covered yet to where we are all comfortable with the subject matter, so there is a learning curve as to how to create objects like the sequence diagram and the the design specific class diagram.

5. What We Should Try Next Time:
   * Scheduling time ahead in the week for an optional secondary online meeting can help the design/implementation process by increasing communication and provide extra avenues to voice concerns or ideas to the group at large in real time.

## Next Steps
* Complete the Deliverable 5 activities.
* Focus on coding our next set of features.
* Begin testing the new code written.
* Start to work on Deliverable 6.
