## Look & Feel:
   - We determined in our first couple of meetings that we wanted the website to be intuitive and clear to understand. A few of our interviewees complained about how ScoutBook was difficult to use, despite being the official app for Scouts; making sure our own website was a least easy to navigate then became a prominent point, even if the website itself was simple in looks. As a group, we settled on a easy to see navigation bar towards the top of the screen, but below the heading of the webpage. The idea was for the heading to pop out, making the navigation bar incredibly easy to find. The tabs that would hosted on the navigation bar would be blunt in this uses; if the tab led to a calendar, the tab should simply be labeled as 'calendar', and the same would go for any features we wanted to add. For the main part of the homepage, we wanted a group's events to be showcased, the very top being whatever pictures were posted from the most recent event, or a reminder for an upcoming event, going backwards; the further down the page you went, the further down the timeline of events you would go.
