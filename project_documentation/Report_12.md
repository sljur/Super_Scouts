## Project Retrospective
* This week we discussed our roles and how to go about Deliverable 7 including who and what we will do for verification and validation.
### Activity Checklist
1. Appreciations:
   * Samantha did an excellent job taking this week's meeting notes.
   * Patricia kept ahead of things this week and began the report on monday.
   * Beatriz, Ben, Dalton and Evan all did great and began work for Deliverable 7 activities.
2. Successes:
    * We were able to look ahead and get started on Deliverable 7 early.
    * We decided what features we wanted to continue developing before the final presentation.
    * Finally we set a time for next week's meeting.
    * Communication throughout the break was kept consistent despite the holiday.
3. Failues:
   * No major failures; we have an outline of what needs to happen and how to do it.
4. Barrier:
   * The biggest barrier this week was working around the holiday schedule.
   * Progress this week was slow, because of the holiday, but we all agreed to continue our work at our own speed.

5. What We Should Try Next Time:
   * For next time we could begin deliverable activities earlier, however with Thanksgiving a slower week of progress is understandable.

## Next Steps
* Complete the Deliverable 7 activities.
* Begin wrapping up the final wave of implemented features before the final implementation before the final.
* Test more of the new code written.
