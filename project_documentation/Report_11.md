## Summary of Activities
- We assigned roles for the week.
- Discussed the strategy for approaching Deliverable 6's activities.
- Assigned which Deliverable 6 sections everyone would work on.
  
## Project Retrospective
- This week we updated each other on the code weâ€™ve been working on, and what parts we wanted to work on for our Deliverable 6. 
We worked a bit on this during last week's meeting, so we already had an idea of what needed to be finished.<br>

### Activity Checklist
1. Appreciations:
   - Evan will work on game implementation for the Requirement section.
   - Ben will mostly work on backend server;C or C++ code; and Code Quality.
   - Sami will work on better Calendar implementation with the ability to add and remove events; Lessons Learned; and a Test.
   - Dalton will work on Progression Tracker code and a Test for it.
   - Beatriz will work on the Introduction.
   - Patricia will work on the Demo.

2. Successes:
   - We were all on the same page of what needed to be done from last meeting;
   - Ben also figured out how the rewritten server code will work, and is in the last stages of tweaking it.

3. Failues:
   * No real failures; we know what needs to be done.

4. Barrier:
   * There are a few things we need to learn in order to incorporate the next steps we want to take for our implementations,
but we know the majority of what it is we need to research.

5. What We Should Try Next Time:
   - We've been doing pretty well with communicating with each other; I think we just need to keep our consistent efforts going coding wise.
## Next Steps
- Complete the Deliverable 6 activities.
- Start planning for Deliverable 7
