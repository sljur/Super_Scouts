## Summary Of Activities
- This week was dedicated mainly to research and finalizing the ground work of the project. We decided that we were each going to pick a feature
  as listed in deliverable 2 and research efficient ways to begin testing and prototyping so we can begin to conceptualize a working product.
- In following up with the server progress, we now have a server and a domain name (superscouts.site), we have begun setting up the server
  and ideally have a place to put our agreed upon features once they are ready to be implemented.
- We discussed the main index.html homepage of the website and how we would like the layout to be using a basic website design complete with a navigation bar and space
  for a home-feed for when it is implemented with group discussions and posts.
- A Scrum type application for the group to use was also discussed. For simplicity's sake we have opted to use clickup as that was the
  application shown in class.
- Deliverable 3 was also discussed, however we opted to wait on progressing with the third deliverable until wednesdays class was over so we
  would have all of the information we would need to complete it.
  
## Project Retrospective
- This week is a bit daunting, yet exciting, we are now at the coding process of our project and we are all doing our best to learn how we can acomplish
  each feature.

### Activity Checklist 
 1. Appreciations: 
   * Everyone did an excellent job with communication this week.
   * Evan and Dalton suggested a very clever use of C code to handle the meta-data for our server.
   * Beatriz had a family emergency and could not make the meeting, but has done an amazing job keeping intouch and informed with this weeks plan.
   * Patricia kept the meeting well structured and concicse with our plan for this week.
   * Sami presented our current chosen layout for our website and showed off her graphic design skills.
   * Ben set up the domain name and the server this week.

2. Successes:
   * Despite having one person absent, communication has been great and everyone has begun their research.
   * Well structured plan for this week and clear goal for everyone was made.
   * Unanimous agreement to prepare for Deliverable 3, but to wait until we had all of the information we needed.

3. Failures: 
   * No major failures, we are beginning to build and test our prototype features, we are likely to find more major faliures in the coming weeks.

4. Barrier: 
   * The largest barrier currently is a lack of knowledge on how to build a website that requires a front and back-end. These are required aspects for fully implementing the features we want,
     but we all lack experience in this subject. We have spent this week learning and we will discuss our findings at the next meeting.

5. What we should try next time.
   * A secondary meeting or checkin via discord to ensure all project related tasks for the week are completed or on track to be completed
     before the due date.
   
## Next Steps
- At the next meeting we will discuss our findings and we will discuss how we want to begin devloping and implementing each feature as a group.
- Deliverable 3 will likely be a major aspect of next weeks activities.
- Put code to server and begin shaing our project into a presentable form.
