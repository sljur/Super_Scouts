# Deliverable 3: Analysis

## 1. System Description:
SuperScouts is a website designed to provide organized and simple communication to group-structured organizations. Disorganization of pertinent information in a group setting plagues every member of a group, the impact of which is inefficiency and loss of time. SuperScouts is an intuitive, community-centered website with an emphasis on scouting that allows for group planning and organization with a basis for progression tracking and community events. By consolidating an activity calendar, discussion **posts**, and other important information for day-to-day operations, SuperScouts effectively combats disorganization by keeping every piece of information a group needs in a single place.

Group activities aren't specific to one demographic; keeping group information in one place means that parents, kids, clubs, scouts, and everyone in between can stay informed with a fraction of the effort. **Leaders** of an organization can sign up with their *name* and *email* and create a group unique to their purpose and share their group so that **members** can ***join***. Group **leaders** are given special privileges that allow for group moderation including a **calendar**, **progression tracker**, and location sharing. **Leaders** can ***create*** a **calendar** for the group containing each **event** planned with the ability to edit **event** details with a *description* complete with *location* and *time*. The **progression tracker** allows **leaders** to create milestones as well as open and close tasks for **members**, directly inspired by the scout badges from offline scouting organizations. Important locations can be shared with the group by the group **leader** and attached to **events** for group **members** to see. All **members** can chat with their group by ***writing*** **messages** moderated by the **leader**, showing each user *name* with every **message**. To encourage interactivity, **members** can ***create*** **media posts** in the group **messages** consisting of files or other *media* with a *description* under the condition that group **leaders** must approve of the content so *others can comment*. **Members** can also play an intereractive **game** to encourage staying up to date on all group information by competeing with others in the group to see who has the highest *score*.

For messaging, SuperScouts will require a **message** hosting API like FireBase or Pusher to enable real-time chatting between group members and group channel creation. Location sharing will require a coordinates-based API like Google Maps to allow for uniform location sharing between a group leader and members. NodeJs will be used to host the server of the website and a C program of our design will handle the metadata users create while online. To promote security, user's contact information will be protected and exclusively available to group leaders. NodeJs will allow us to keep the server running 24/7 keeping SuperScouts fast and reliable. The core principle of SuperScouts is keeping group information consolidated and intuitive, careful design of the SuperScout's UI will ensure that SuperScouts can be by anyone.
